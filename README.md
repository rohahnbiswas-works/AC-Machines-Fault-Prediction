An innovative ML model was deployed and trained on several AC machines fault values (Voltages, Currents etc), and was made as a small-scale project as a part of the “AC Machines” course. In a nutshell, this model, after being trained and optimized can predict a fault in the system when provided with a set of voltage and current values to a machine. The code was written in colab (file attached). It can also be opened in colab with a simple click.
