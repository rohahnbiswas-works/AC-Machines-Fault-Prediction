This particular ML model was trained on several AC machines fault values(Voltages,Currents etc), and was made as a small scale course project for my degree course of AC Machines.
In a nutshell, this particular model, after being trained and optimized can predict if there is a fault in the system or not when provided with a set of voltages and current values of a machine based on it trained data.
The code was written in colab and i have added the same colab file here. One can also open it in colab with a simple click.
